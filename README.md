# IMA-203: Variational and Bayesian methods & discrete optimization
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course IMA-203 at Télécom Paris 

This course introduces variational and Bayesian methods for image filtering and segmentation. Particular attention will be paid to optimization methods involved in this context. Applications from the fields of digital photography, remote sensing and medical images will illustrate the interest of these approaches.
- Variational methods
- Deformable models
- Bayesian methods, Markov random fields
- Discrete optimization using graph cuts
